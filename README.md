# DjangoWebSockets-MQTT

## Brief Idea:
Project can be sub divided as follows:-  
* We need to register sensors 
* We need to register client
* We need to provide client with the sensor data he clicks on
* Use of WebSocket or MQTT to send data from the server to the client's application

## Techincals:
* Building WebSocket API with Django
* Can implement front-end with Django views only
* Using Mosquitto framework for MQTT communication
* Dashboard implementation through front-end frameworks like AngularJS.
